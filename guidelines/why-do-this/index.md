## Benefits

### For Designers and Developers

A repository of accessible standards compliant design assets, research and code. It is tested, readily available and re-usable. It enables designers and developers to concentrate on creating new and delightful experiences for our audience. It gives the opportunity to contribute to something bigger than an assigned task.

And, it stops us from redesigning and building the same things over and over again.

The DLS gives us a platform to more easily test concepts and interfaces with our audience. These concepts can then be centrally iterated upon as we learn. We do it in the one place.

DLS templates and patterns are integrated into the organisation wide wCMS to provide a true network experience for our audience and production tool for our content creators.

### For content experts
The DLS strives to, rather than creating a multitude of websites, create a place for content and experience. It removes the barriers that current website construction and management involves. It enables content makers to focus on the thing that matters most to them, creating engaging, immersive audience experiences.

Through code standardisation and optimisation, content accessibility, speed, indexation and performance will be improved, allowing for stories and experiences to be delivered to our audience faster, and in a  more discoverable way.
 
### For our audience
The DLS speaks directly to the ABC mission. It enables us to ***better deliver outstanding content and services that are indispensable to society in a transforming media environment***.

Through utilising our **Service Enablers**, we can encourage a more organic way of delivering and navigating the breadth of the ABC content. We can empower our audience to engage in sharable experiences that are of most interest to them, when and where they want to.

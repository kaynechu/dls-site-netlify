title: DLS for developers

## Get started with Abstract

The Design Language System (DLS) serves as a tool to design for the web and native apps. The purpose of this system is to ensure a coherent functionality, visual identity and language, along with the most common usability and accessibility aspects. The DLS helps to ensure coherence both inside an product and between separate products for all ABC digital products across platforms.

The DLS is not the same as the brand guidelines. However, the DLS provides best practices examples on how to coherently use the brand attributes to apply a unified visual identity system across the ABC digital properties.

The DLS is not meant to be read, but used. It is an ever-evolving manual for building blocks across all ABC digital properties that everyone across the organisation should follow.

## How to branch, commit and merge

Abstract allows teams to version, manage and collaborate on Sketch files using branching, committing and merging to the Master. Abstract is forgiving, allowing teams to access a history of commits and roll back changes.

### Top tips

- NEVER work directly in the Master branch
- When you branch off from Master, please do not delete any files - this will result in the files being deleted from the Master branch when you merge to Master

## DLS Design Workflow

This workflow outlines contribution to the DLS (propose new component or a change to an existing component).
This workflow does not cover trivial changes.

## Sketch naming conventions

A consistent approach naming symbols and Sketch file layout improves communication and makes the libraries easier to navigate.

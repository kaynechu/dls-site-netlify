intro: 
description: Useful systems are critical for performance because they encourage people to stay longer, do more, come back and refer others.

> useful = utility + usability

**Utility** is determined by whether the system provides the features needed (user requirements).
**Usability**  assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. Usability is defined by 5 quality components:

- Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
- Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
- Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
- Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?
  
Determining usefulness means understanding requirements, designing for these needs and confirming synergies between requirements and design.

Examples of how ABC designs satisfy [Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) are listed below.

## ABC systems design

### Heuristic 1: Visibility of system status

> The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Feedback is provided whenever users interact with ABC pages. For example, when users choose to 'follow' a story button text immediately changes to 'following' and the "+" icon changes to a tick:

### Heuristic 2: Match between system and the real world

> The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Terms and phrases used across the ABC website reflect those used in common language for broad understanding, and content flows in logical sequence.

#### Example: Article page

For example, each article features:

- Subheadings that accurately define their purpose:  "Key points", "More on this story" and "Related stories"
- Content that specifically relates to it's preceding heading
- Familiar icons to 'save', 'comment' or share the article
